disable minimap for large files
const editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById("container"), {
value: largeFileContent, // your file content
language: 'javascript',
scrollBeyondLastLine: false,
minimap: {
enabled: false // disabling minimap for large files
},
automaticLayout: true, // ensures that the editor re-measures its container when needed
});

Memory Management:
Monitor and manage memory usage actively. Large files can still lead to significant memory use, which can slow down the browser or lead to crashes. Techniques such as disposing of editor instances when not needed and careful management of references can help.

how to check for memory leaks using chrome dev tools for js

how to check the performance of the website using dev tools? is it possible?

can i check how my website performs under cases like very large files? can the dev tools of the browser do this?

<!-- 1.  store openend tabs in mongodb.
    get the tabs list on the first editor load. -->

2.  get data for the focused file/tab first -> using fetch stream

get data for the rest of the opened tab/files only -> using fetch stream

3.  when a new tab is added / a new file is focused, get data for that file only -> using fetch stream

4.  when a file is modified using the codeEditor, update only this file (focusedFileName) -> post data to the backend using batchUpdate (denounce)

find the most efficient way to do this.

differential updates :)

5.  when files are modified using the terminal,
    what if the file is thousands of lines long, should i still update the whole file even when just one line was changed?
    how to properly update the files ? how to find out which file to update?

keep in mind the sleep 5 && echo sth > newfile bug too

also, vim updates of existing / new files

differential updates from server side?

chokidar and websockets -> frontend knows the filenames for the updated files.
fetch stream -> the files which are present in the opened tabs.

\*.
use fetch streaming for everything:

<!-- get tabs -->

<!-- get focusedTab's file data -->

<!-- get all tabs file data -->

<!-- differntial updates for edits made through the editor -->

chokidar for updates through xterm
send the filename to the frontend
if the file is present in the tabs, get file data
if not, don't get file data

<!-- explorer click -> get file data & then -> update tabs -->

<!-- on tab switch -> no request to backend -->
