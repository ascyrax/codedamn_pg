codedamn full-stack developer assignment


Problem statement: Develop a basic codedamn playground-like interface

Technologies to use:
React/Next.js for a basic frontend (mandatory)
TypeScript on the frontend (mandatory)
Monaco editor as code editor (mandatory)
Xterm.js for terminal preview (recommended)

Live example: https://codedamn.com/playgrounds

Functionalities to implement:
A code editor on frontend
A terminal on frontend
Multiple resizable windows
Multiple file support in monaco editor
Code files are saved and restored when someone refreshes the page (use backend database to persist user code)
Preview window for editor output
A working terminal (can you connect it to a real backend terminal?)
Docker containers (can you containerize user sessions so that multiple users can use your service at once?)

Evaluation criteria phase 1:
You only have to complete the phase1 if you're applying for the job for the first time.
Create a detailed spec on:
Technologies you'll choose
Decisions you'll make on infrastructure
With apt justification for every decision


Evaluation criteria (phase 2):
How "boring" the code is (we love boring code, exciting and complex code is usually bad smell)
Functionalities you implemented
Code cleanliness, is working or not, and best practices (no use of `var` please)
Architecture design - how you designed the user flow
GitHub repo README.md instructions

Duration: 10 days from the time you received email from your interview handler

Submission (phase 2):
Submit your code as a public GitHub repository URL. 
Your project should also be deployed online in a production level environment. Vercel for frontend (Next.js/React) and AWS/DigitalOcean/Azure/Google Cloud for backend is recommended.


Some Notes (phase 2):
Make sure your README.md instructions in GitHub repo are clear and we are able to test your project smoothly.
Make sure your code works, and is maintainable.
Ask for any doubts (non-code related) on the same email thread as your interview handler contacted you on 
Best of luck
